Game Outline
------------
This is a game where the player takes control of a character, and plays through
their life, as they interact with a complex and living world around them. The 
player's actions should be able to affect their world profoundly, and this will
be governed by the fact that there will be a renown system, where if a
character in the game doesn't have a sufficiently high renown score, their
children will be "garbage collected" upon their death, unless they somehow
achieve enough renown on their own.

The project is called *Regiment of Foot* because that is the arbitrary cutoff I
have chosen for characters to be elidgible to interact with the world. If they 
are well known engough to command a regiment of foot, then they deserve to have
an independent intelligence in the game. Of course there will be people who are
less than that in the world, but they will be simulated rather more abstractly,
as numbers or something. The idea will be that if the character would get a 
name in a book about the player, then they should be simulated with percision 
and care.
